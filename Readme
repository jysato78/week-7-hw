Train Scheduler

This app acts as a train schedule that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve 
and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, 
namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  JavaScript, CSS and jQuery were used
to add style and manipulate the HTML.

The user needs to enter the necessary information regarding a train.  If they hit the submit button without filling out all the 
fields, they will get an alert and be asked to fill out everything.  If they hit the submit button after the form is complete, their
new train gets added and displayed.
